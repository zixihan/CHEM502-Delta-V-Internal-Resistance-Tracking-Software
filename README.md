# CHEM_502
Please read this before using python_delta_voltage.py.

The data collected from lab needs to be in file "Data.txt". 
The path of the file needs to be the same as the program "python_delta_voltage.py".

Formating required of Data.txt file:
[Charging Capacity] [Discharging Capacity] [Charging Energy] [Discharging Energy]

For example: 

0.68869	0.62762	2.63114	2.32525
0.19554	0.19468	0.76608	0.71206

After the program was initialted, it would ask for an input for the total cycle numbers. 

The output values for the program would be in the file "Output.txt". 

Example output: 

0.115630601
0.26017424
